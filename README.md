## üß† Overview

The program opens your webcam, grabs video frames in real time, and detects the color of the pixel at the center of the frame using HSV values. The detected color name is displayed on the video feed along with a small target marker.

This tool is useful for:
- Learning HSV-based color detection
- Color recognition in robotics or automation
- Educational demos and computer vision tutorials
